VirtualHandSharp
================

The first publicly available C# wrapper for the CyberGlove's "VirtualHand" SDK. Created by Arno Sluismans and Steven Vervaet at Rovaniemi University of Applied Sciences (RAMK) as part of their internship project, under supervision of Juha Laakko, Perttu Rauhala, Hellevi Leppiaho and Veerle Asaert. 

Place the inputfiles/ folder's contents in the output folder, so that the TestProgram works properly. The inputfiles contain the ROCK, PAPER and SCISSORS positions, the GRASP and RELEASE motions, and an emulation record that performs some positions and motions in about 11 seconds at 24 fps.
